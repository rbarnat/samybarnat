Psychology is in great need of such a powerful concision and this article aims to bring such a Newtonian revolution concerning the dynamics of emotions, happiness, stress, the therapeutic role of laugh, how humans unconsciously form unhealthy personalities and the basis to heal. The masterpiece of this new paradigm is called the Fundamental Principle of the Dynamics of Emotions (FPDE) which gives powerful simple explanations of the mechanisms of all emotions including happiness. A questionnaire has showed that 93% of people interrogated agree with the explanations given by this principle (FPDE). After thousands of years to this essential question for humanity the basis of the science of happiness is finally completely and clearly explained.It is the first brick laying down the foundations to construct a new unifying paradigm for psychology bringing all together cognitive psychology, psychoanalysis, behaviourism and personality psychology.

            <h4 class="card-title">Clarify the confusion around “emotions” and “feelings”</h4>
            <p class="card-text text-justify">Darwin was one of the first major scientific work on human emotions. He only listed few of emotions and Ekman who was recognized as the world leading expert on emotions also listed few emotions one century later. But recently we have seen a shift of this paradigm towards a huge list of emotions which reach many thousands for some scientists. A correction of the whole scientific paradigm around emotions is clearly needed as it is going into the wrong direction because of a confusion between feelings and emotions. This article should is complementary to another article called “The Fundamental Principles of Happiness and Emotions” (Barnat, 2019a) which is the key to understand the specificity of emotions: a cognitive comparison between perceived reality and desire.

            <h4 class="card-title">A happy personality depends mostly on your thoughts, not your genetics</h4>
            <p class="card-text text-justify">Happiness is one of the most profound desires and purposes of human life. Many have tried to solve the mystery of happiness from philosophers thousands of years ago to psychologists more recently. Many made significant progress but no one managed to come to a satisfying theory explaining in a concise and complete way the dynamics of happiness. A main barrier in the current scientific literature explains why this has not been discovered before: a paradigm that has long dominated psychology concerning happiness. It is the dangerous paradigm attributing 50% to 100% in other studies of happiness to genetics. 50 or 100%? Incoherent conclusions forecasting cracks in the theory of Set Point of Well Being as announced by Headey. Simply the collapse of theories based on extrapolation of data by scientists over enthusiastic about genetics. It is dangerous to mislead people to think they can’t change their happiness level because it is mainly due to genetics, risking them to abandon and condemning them to unhappiness by creating limiting beliefs of an incapacity to change. Another article bring the solution to this major problem it is called the “Fundamental Principles of the Dynamics of Emotions” (FPDE, Barnat, 2019a), obviously including happiness. It is the missing piece to achieve to destroy the dangerous paradigm attributing happiness to genetics that we as scientists have all a responsibility to stop propagating as it is wrongly misleading people to think they mainly can’t do anything about their happiness and risking a self-fulfilling prophecy.

            <p class="card-text text-justify">The Fundamental Principle of the Dynamics of Emotions (FPDE, see Barnat, 2019a) is the basis of a revolution concerning the dynamics of emotions, happiness, stress, the therapeutic role of laugh, how humans unconsciously form unhealthy personalities and the basis to heal. It gives powerful simple explanations of the mechanisms of all emotions including happiness. This article take the consequences of the FPDE to the construction of personalities. It shows that starting from a feeling or parents imitation humans can construct unhealthy personalities like “be perfect”, “be the best”… Explaining why so many people are chronically unhappy simply because the desires at the basis of their personalities can only lead to regular emotional suffering because they are impossible to constantly be fulfilled. Indeed we all do mistakes so a personality based on the desire to “be perfect” will as explained by the FPDE make us suffer regularly, same for “be the best”, “be loved by everyone”… The famous neuorsis, schizophrenia and many other mental illnesses described by psychoanalysis without deep explanations of the cause finally find an explanation here. And it gives a cognitive explanation: emotions result from a comparison between perceived reality and desires (FPDE). It is the first brick laying down the foundations to construct a new unifying paradigm for psychology bringing all together cognitive psychology, psychoanalysis, behaviourism and personality psychology… After thousands of years to this essential question for humanity the basis of the science of happiness is finally completely and clearly explained.

            <p class="card-text text-justify">To give a choice to readers and publishers I have given two options: either a shorter version of four articles published separately on this website and referencing each other, either this longer version with all four articles merged. <br/> The Fundamental Principle of Dynamics of Newton was a revolution for physics, not many concise small set of equations had such a high impact on science. Psychology is in great need of such a powerful concision, this article aims to bring such a Newtonian revolution. The masterpiece of this new paradigm is called the Fundamental Principle of the Dynamics of Emotions (FPDE) which gives powerful simple explanations of the mechanisms of all emotions including happiness and the therapeutic role of laugh. A questionnaire has showed that 93% of people interrogated agree with the explanations given by the FPDE. Two main barriers in the current scientific literature collapse as a result. First barrier: the dangerous paradigm from Lykken and al. attributing 50% of happiness to genetics and 100% in other studies. 50 or 100? Incoherent conclusions forecasting cracks in the theory of Set Point of Well Being as announced by Headey, simply the result of extrapolation of data by scientists over enthusiastic about genetics. It is dangerous to condemn people to unhappiness by creating limiting beliefs that they can’t change their happiness level because it is mainly due to genetics and mislead them to abandon. Second barrier: the current paradigm around emotions went into the wrong direction with some scientists confused between feelings and emotions now listing tens of thousands of emotions in disagreement with Ekman and Darwin. After thousands of years to this essential question for humanity the basis of the science of happiness is finally completely and clearly explained.
